To make the pastry, sift the flour into a large mixing bowl and add the butter or margarine. Using your fingers, mix together until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs.\nAdd about 3 tbsp cold water  1 tbsp at a time  to bind the mixture into a ball. Then wrap it in cling film and leave to chill in the fridge while you prepare the apples, or for 30 mins if you have time.\nWhile the pastry is chilling, core the apples, then cut into even-sized chunks so they all cook in the same amount of time. Put the apples into the pie dish, drizzle over the honey and add the cinnamon, mixed spice and about 2 tbsp water.\nRoll out the pastry on a floured work surface until it is large enough to cover the pie dish. Using the rolling pin, carefully lift the pastry and lay it over the top of the apple mixture. Carefully trim off the excess pastry (this can be rerolled and cut into shapes to decorate the pie crust if you like) and press the pastry edges onto the dish to create a seal.\nMake a small cut in the pastry so that the air can escape during cooking, then brush with beaten egg to glaze.\nBake the pie in the oven for 20-30 mins until the pastry is golden and sandy in appearance and the apple filling is bubbling and hot. Serve while still warm with crme frache, ice cream or natural yogurt.", extendedIngredients: [Spoonacular.Ingridient(id: 20081, name: "plain flour", image: "flour.png", amount: 225.0, unit: "g"), Spoonacular.Ingridient(id: 1001, name: "butter", image: "butter-sliced.jpg", amount: 140.0, unit: "g"), Spoonacular.Ingridient(id: 9003, name: "apples", image: "apple.jpg", amount: 3.0, unit: "large"), Spoonacular.Ingridient(id: 19296, name: "honey", image: "honey.png", amount: 2.0, unit: "tbsp"), Spoonacular.Ingridient(id: 2010, name: "cinnamon", image: "cinnamon.jpg", amount: 1.0, unit: "pinch"), Spoonacular.Ingridient(id: 1022035, name: "mixed spice", image: "ground-coriander.jpg", amount: 1.0, unit: "pinch"), Spoonacular.Ingridient(id: 1123, name: "egg", image: "egg.png", amount: 1.0, unit: ""), Spoonacular.Ingridient(id: 1001116, name: "natural yogurt", image: "plain-yogurt.jpg", amount: 1.0, unit: "serving")], sourceUrl: "https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/apple-pie", vegetarian: true, vegan: false, glutenFree: false, dairyFree: false, veryHealthy: false, cheap: false, healthScore: 4, sourceName: "BBC Good Food", pricePerServing: 112.51)
